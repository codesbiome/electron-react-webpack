              Once upon a time there was a little prick who wanted to create
              <br />a basic application using ElectronJS, React and Webpack.
              <br />
              After struggling for hours in search of a decent boilerplate
              <br />
              he couldn't find any good results to begin with...
              <br />
              <br />
              His morale was down, with a sad face he decided to go to bed...
              <br />
              But then on next morning, he got up and planned to waste
              <br />
              another day of his life just to write the boilerplate code himself.
              <br />
              <br />
              After investing plenty of hours, the result was heart-warming
              <br />
              "Keep your hopes higher than morale!"
