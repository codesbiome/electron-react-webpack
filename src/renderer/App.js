                Once upon a time there was a little prick who wanted to create
                <br />a basic application using ElectronJS, React and Webpack.
                <br />
                After struggling for hours in search of a decent boilerplate
                <br />
                he couldn't find any good results to begin with...
                <br />
                <br />
                His morale was down, with a sad face he decided to go to bed...
                <br />
                But then on next morning, he got up and planned to waste
                <br />
                another day of his life just to write the boilerplate code himself.
                <br />
                <br />
                After investing plenty of hours, the result was heart-warming
                <br />
                "Keep your hopes higher than morale!"
